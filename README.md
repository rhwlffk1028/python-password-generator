  ## Description
  This program allows you to generate a random password from list of letters, symbols, and numbers based on user's inputs. User will be asked to provide number of letters, symbols, and numbers for their password and it will generate random password. There are two types of passwords. First, users will be given with random password but with an order (letters, symbols, and numbers). Second, users will be given with random password but with no order (letters, symbols, and numbers are all mixed up), which will have more security.
